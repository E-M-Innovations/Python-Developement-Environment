# Purpose

The project aims to establish a Python Development environment that encompasses automated documentation, seamless unit testing, and efficient dependency management. Moreover, all these functionalities are containerized using Docker.  We will be utilizing specific tools and dependencies, namely Sphinx for automated documentation, pytest for unit testing, and poetry for dependency management.

To achieve this, we will create a Dockerfile that defines the instructions for building the Docker image. The Docker image will encapsulate the entire Python Development environment, including the necessary dependencies and configurations for Sphinx, pytest, and poetry.

Sphinx, a widely-used documentation generator, will be integrated into the environment to automate the documentation process. It will allow developers to write human-readable documentation alongside their Python code and generate HTML, PDF, or other documentation formats effortlessly.

For seamless unit testing, the environment will incorporate pytest, a popular testing framework in the Python ecosystem. Developers can easily write test cases using pytest's expressive syntax, run tests, and obtain comprehensive test reports to ensure the reliability and correctness of their code.

To streamline dependency management, the environment will leverage poetry, a powerful dependency management tool for Python. Poetry simplifies the process of defining and resolving dependencies, enabling developers to manage project dependencies, handle versioning, and ensure consistency across different environments.

Combining these tools and dependencies, we will configure the Docker image to include all the necessary components for a robust Python Development environment. This Docker image can be easily shared, distributed, and deployed across various systems and platforms, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in the development process.

In summary, the project aims to establish a Python Development environment that encompasses automated documentation, seamless unit testing, and efficient dependency management. Through the use of Docker and specific tools like Sphinx, pytest, and poetry, we will create a containerized environment that enhances the development experience and facilitates collaboration among developers.
