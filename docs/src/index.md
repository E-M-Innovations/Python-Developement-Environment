# Python Development Environment

The project creates a containerized Python Development environment with automated documentation, seamless unit testing, and efficient dependency management using tools like Sphinx, pytest, and poetry.

[Purpose ](./purpose.md)

Designing Poetry, Docker, Cython, Sphinx and Pytest for a streamlined workflow. The process involves setting up separate directories on the host machine and copying necessary files to the Docker image. It also requires configuring Cython to work with Sphinx and Pytest while running Pytest exclusively on the Docker machine.
